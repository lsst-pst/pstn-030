The Education and Public Outreach team is constructing a unique, online program to achieve our mission of providing non-specialists access to and context for, LSST data.  This document will describe in detail the technical infrastructure decisions made by the EPO team when constructing this program. The goal is for any person interested in our program to be able to reference this document to understand each component of the program as well as the motivation behind its design.  However, the intended audience is members of other current or future EPO teams who are interested in building new programs.

Below we outline the main components of our approach.
