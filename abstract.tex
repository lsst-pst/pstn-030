The Rubin Observatory Education and Public Outreach program is a unique, online program with the mission of providing non-specialists access to and context for, LSST data.  This document describes the technical infrastructure that serves all the activities the program delivers to various non-specialist audiences. The main tenants of the program infrastructure are to maximize accessibility and usability across common devices used by the public and in the classroom.  All code is open source. The goal is for any person interested in our program to be able to reference this document to understand each component of the program as well as the motivation behind its technical design and implementation. (The intended audience is members of other current or future EPO teams who are interested in building new programs.)
